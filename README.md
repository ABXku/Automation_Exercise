## About
        [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com) is a website where all QA engineers can practice web automation and API testing. They also provide us with test case instructions so we can follow along. For this project, I'll focus on automation testing using Robot Framework and Selenium as the main tools.

## Problem To Be Fixed
        You'll see that some test cases failed, that is because the Google Vignette ads always comes up during the test, and that makes my test case fail. Up until now, I still couldn't find the solution to this problem. If you guys know how to fix this, you can answer it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77351388/disable-google-vignette-ads-on-chrome).
